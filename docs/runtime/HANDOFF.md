## 1. Outcome first

Step 3 (Architecture and Execution Blueprint) is fully closed (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, 16/16 outputs — see `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`). **Phase 0 — Discovery and Foundation is now underway.** Prompt 80 (`CG-S5-PH0-001`) validated all 5 Phase 0 entry-gate conditions, reconciled the 10-level hierarchy for all 18 Phase 0 capabilities, and produced a full execution register for the 22 downstream prompts (`docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` + companion `_phase0_wbs.md`).

**Result:** `PH0-081` (Source Alignment and Context Bootstrap, task ID `CG-S5-PH0-002`) is `READY` with every variable resolvable. `PH0-082..102` are correctly `BLOCKED` on their exact unmet upstream ranges — this is expected: the execution index found the Phase 0 dependency graph is a **strict single sequential lane** (`081→082→…→098→099→100→101→102`), since every downstream capability's dependency range grows monotonically to "all prior," combined with the standing single-writer rule (`ISS-2026-002`). No parallel lane exists in Phase 0 — do not attempt to skip ahead or run two capability prompts concurrently.

**Naming-convention note (standing for all Phase 0 build logs):** the package's own prompt text names outputs `docs/build-log/phase-00/PH0-NN.md` (singular, phase-nested). This repository's established convention (used since Step 2) is `docs/build-logs/` (plural, flat, one file per task, e.g. `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-002_source_alignment_context_bootstrap.md`). Use the plural, flat convention for every future Phase 0 build log — this substitution rule is documented in `CG-S5-PH0-001`'s own build logs and must be applied consistently, not re-litigated per task.

**Branch (standing):** this session's designated continuation branch is `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` (not `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build`, superseded).

**Environment note (standing):** commit signing is configured but the signing key file is empty in this environment, so commits show "Unverified" on GitHub — a pre-existing environment limitation, not something to fix by editing gnupg/ssh config. Author identity (`Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`) is correct on all commits.

Current task status: `CG-S5-PH0-001` = `VERIFIED`. **Phase state: `PHASE_0_IN_PROGRESS` (1 of 22 downstream prompts complete).**
Safe to continue: `YES`. Immediate blocker: `NONE`.

## 2. Mandatory reading order

1. Repository `AGENTS.md` (root) — confirms `docs/runtime/` is canonical.
2. `docs/runtime/CARGOGRID_CONTEXT.md`.
3. `docs/runtime/CARGOGRID_BUILD_STATUS.md`.
4. `docs/runtime/TASK_LEDGER.md` (records `CG-S3-ARCH-001..016` all `VERIFIED`; `CG-S5-PH0-001` `VERIFIED`; `CG-S5-PH0-002` `READY`).
5. `docs/runtime/CHANGE_MANIFEST.md` (`CHG-2026-004` through `CHG-2026-020`).
6. `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` and `_phase0_wbs.md` in full — this is the authoritative Phase 0 dependency graph and per-task register; read before assuming any Phase 0 task's inputs/outputs/allowed paths.
7. Next prompt: `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/05-phase-00-discovery-foundation/81_SOURCE_ALIGNMENT_CONTEXT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` (read in full — do not assume its output path or fields from this handoff; confirm from the prompt itself).

**Feature/application code remains forbidden** until Phase 0's own closure prompt (`102_PHASE0_CLOSURE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT.md`) sets `PHASE_0_VERIFIED`. Do not edit `docs/blueprint/**` or `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/**` except to read.

## 3. Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository/working dir | `/home/user/cargogrid.app` (origin `assujiar/cargogrid.app`) |
| Branch | `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` (this session's designated branch) |
| Dirty worktree | This checkpoint's changes only (documentation) |
| Package manager/runtime/schema/env | NONE (greenfield; Phase 0's own capability prompts, starting around `PH0-085`, are the first to create real toolchain/environment artifacts — `PH0-081` itself is documentation-only) |
| Canonical context location | `docs/runtime/` (do not recreate root duplicates) |
| Trust boundary | Repository + package + sources trusted; no app/database/environment exists yet |

## 4. Active task (next)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Task ID/name | `CG-S5-PH0-002` — Source Alignment and Context Bootstrap |
| Prompt | `05-phase-00-discovery-foundation/81_SOURCE_ALIGNMENT_CONTEXT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` |
| Objective | First Phase 0 capability slice — bootstrap authoritative context/registers per the execution index's own hierarchy row (Governance and Source Control → Authoritative Product Baseline) |
| Status | `READY` — sole upstream `CG-S5-PH0-001` satisfied; every variable resolvable (execution index §3, WBS §5) |
| Output | Per the prompt's own required-output field (confirm when reading it — expected: updates to `docs/runtime/CARGOGRID_CONTEXT.md` plus a build log at `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-002_source_alignment_context_bootstrap.md`, per repo convention) |
| Allowed paths | Per execution index §3's `PH0-081` row: repository governance/context/status/ledger/build-log documentation only (`docs/runtime/*.md`, `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-002_*.md`); normally 5–15 files |
| Upstream | `CG-S5-PH0-001` (VERIFIED) |

## 5. Work completed (this run — 4 checkpoints on `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`: 3 closed Step 3, 1 opened Phase 0; 13 checkpoints previously on `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build`, merged in)

- **Prompts 36–48** (`01_*.md`–`13_*.md`): completed on `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build` by prior runs; merged forward this run.
- **Prompt 49** (`14_REQUIREMENT_PHASE_TRACEABILITY.md`): 401-item traceability matrix. `CHG-2026-017`.
- **Prompt 50** (`15_RISK_RANKED_CRITICAL_PATH.md`): 9-dimension reproducible CRS ranking. `CHG-2026-018`.
- **Prompt 51** (`16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`): independent Step 3 closure verification, `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, Findings F1/F2 corrected. `CHG-2026-019`. **Step 3 fully closed.**
- **Prompt 80** (`CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` + `_phase0_wbs.md`): Phase 0 entry-gate validation, full 22-prompt execution register, single-sequential-lane concurrency model, zero collision risk. `CHG-2026-020`. **Phase 0 kicked off.**
- Updated `TASK_LEDGER.md`, `CARGOGRID_BUILD_STATUS.md`, `CHANGE_MANIFEST.md`, `CARGOGRID_CONTEXT.md` after all four checkpoints; committing and pushing this one next.

## 6. Remaining work

| Item | State | Safe next action |
|---|---|---|
| `PH0-081` Source Alignment and Context Bootstrap | `READY` | Execute next |
| `PH0-082..098` (17 remaining capabilities) | `BLOCKED` on sequential upstream | Execute in strict order per execution index |
| `PH0-099..102` (verification/hardening/documentation/closure) | `BLOCKED` on `PH0-098` | Execute after all 18 capabilities `VERIFIED` |
| Phase 1+ business-domain implementation | `NOT_STARTED`, blocked on `PHASE_0_VERIFIED` | Do not begin until Phase 0 closes |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-020`/`021` (component-library/design-token foundation) | Deferred | Resolves inside `PH0-090` |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-022`/`023` (test-runner/DR-cadence tooling) | Deferred | Resolves inside `PH0-091` |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-024..027` (CI/CD, secrets, observability, hosting/CDN) | Deferred | Resolve inside `PH0-085`/`088`/`093` (per execution index's concurrency-lane analysis — these 4 are internally order-independent but each resolves inside its own sequential slice, not a separate WBS row) |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-011` (no empty domain-folder stubs) | Deferred | Phase 0 kickoff (candidate: `PH0-083`/`087`) |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-012..015,017..019` (schema/config/API implementation-level) | Deferred | Phase 1/3 implementation (later, not Phase 0) |
| `.gitignore` (`ISS-2026-003`) | `PLANNED` | Close at or before `PH0-085`/`087` |
| SME-engagement pull-forward recommendation (`15_*.md` §4.2) | Recommendation, not yet acted on | Operator/owner decision — surface during Phase 0, not a blocking action |
| `GAP-017` (SaaS billing vs. tenant-finance ID separation) | Closed to `PARTIAL_BLOCKED` with named closure task (`14_*.md` §23) | Phase 1 Platform Core capability slice |
| `MDM-RISK-001..006` | Tracked across `01_*.md`–`10_*.md` only | Consider folding into `docs/discovery/11_TECHNICAL_DEBT_RISK_REGISTER.md` if reopened |
| `docs/blueprint/tes.md` deletion | Classified, not deleted | Needs owner approval — unchanged |
| `ISS-2026-002` enforced fix | Still `OPEN` | Single writer maintained (`claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`) |
| PR for `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` | Not yet opened | Not requested by operator |

Migration state: `NOT_CREATED`. Pre-existing/change-caused test failures: NONE (no gates exist yet — `PH0-088`/`091` are the first to create any).

## 7. Errors, issues, decisions

| ID | Type/status | Summary | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ERR-2026-001` | Error / `RECOVERED` (prior checkpoints) | Parallel-session merge corruption | Not recurred this run |
| `ISS-2026-002` | Issue / `OPEN` | No single-writer discipline enforced by tooling | `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` is the designated continuation branch; Phase 0's own WBS additionally enforces a strict sequential lane |
| `ISS-2026-003` | Issue / `PLANNED` | No root `.gitignore` | Close at or before `PH0-085`/`087` |
| `ISS-2026-001` | Issue / `RESOLVED` | `tes.md` classified `CONFIRMED_PLACEHOLDER` | Awaiting owner-approved deletion |
| RPD-001/004/012/014/015/016/019/022/023/025/031/032/033/034/035/036/037/038/039/040 | Decisions / standing | Ratified defaults, cited throughout `01–16_*.md` | Preserved, not weakened; resurface in Phase 0 starting `PH0-084` (ADR baseline) and `PH0-094` (security) |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-001..010,016` (10 resolved) | Resolved | See `04_*.md`–`08_*.md` | Closed |
| `ADR-CAND-ARCH-011..015,017..027` (17 open) | Tracked, open | Implementation-level ADR candidates | Non-blocking; resolve per §6 above, several inside upcoming Phase 0 slices |
| Tax/legal SME gate (`FIN-195`), Payroll/tax SME gate (`HRT-282`) | Evidence gate | Must be verified by current legal/finance/tax SMEs before Phase 4/7 activation | Not a Phase 0 blocker |
| F1/F2 (Step 3 closure findings) | Found + corrected | See `HO-20260714-019` for detail | Closed |
| `13_*.md` gap-requirement count (corrected to 13) | Found + corrected | Both citations updated | Closed |

## 8. Recovery and rollback

- Last known good: `origin/main`@`39d923e` (pre-PR#8) / `origin/main`@`27389a4` (post-PR#8).
- Code revert: `git revert` the relevant checkpoint commit(s) (documentation-only so far).
- Must not: recreate root-level context duplicates; edit `docs/blueprint/**` or `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/**` except to read; start Phase 1+ feature code before `PHASE_0_VERIFIED`; write outside `docs/**` before the specific Phase 0 capability prompt authorizes it; skip ahead in the Phase 0 sequential lane (e.g. do not attempt `PH0-085` before `PH0-081..084` are `VERIFIED`); open a second parallel session without coordinating; resume work on `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build` (superseded).
- Phase 0-specific rollback: if any `PH0-081..098` task fails, halt at that task; use Step 4 Template 73 (resume-failed-task) or 74 (resume-interrupted-phase); if rolling back, unwind in strict reverse order (`102←101←...←081`) and re-declare every downstream task `BLOCKED` again — per the execution index §5's recovery-order rule.

## 9. Resume instructions

1. Confirm repo `/home/user/cargogrid.app`, branch `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`, worktree clean apart from this checkpoint.
2. Read §2 records; do not rely on this handoff alone — especially re-read `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` for the authoritative per-task register.
3. Re-baseline: `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse HEAD`; confirm it matches the execution index's cited checkpoint (or re-verify if it has advanced — the index's own stale-evidence trigger #1 covers this).
4. Read `05-phase-00-discovery-foundation/81_SOURCE_ALIGNMENT_CONTEXT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` in full before acting.
5. Execute `PH0-081`; update ledgers + change manifest + this handoff + the execution index (mark `PH0-081` `VERIFIED`, `PH0-082` `READY`). Continue looping through as many subsequent Phase 0 capability prompts as usage/context allow in the same run, in strict sequential order — completing one prompt is not a stop condition.

First safe action: read `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` in full, then `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/05-phase-00-discovery-foundation/81_SOURCE_ALIGNMENT_CONTEXT_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`.
