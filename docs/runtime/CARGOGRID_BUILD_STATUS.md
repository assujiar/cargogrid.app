## 1. Current checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Package/repository version | Package `0.18.0-step17` (`FINAL_PACKAGE_VALIDATED`); runtime Step 2 **closed**; Step 3 **in progress** (15/16 prompts) |
| Current phase/workstream | Runtime Step 3 — Architecture and Execution Blueprint (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_IN_PROGRESS`) |
| Active task | `CG-S3-ARCH-015` — Risk-Ranked Critical Path (Prompt 50) |
| Active task status | `VERIFIED` — `docs/architecture/15_RISK_RANKED_CRITICAL_PATH.md` complete |
| Branch | `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build` (cut from `origin/main`@`39d923e`; tracked by GitHub PR #7) |
| HEAD | this checkpoint's commit on `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build` |
| Last known good commit | `origin/main`@`39d923e` |
| Schema/migration head | NONE (no database — this checkpoint is a risk-ranking *plan*, no implementation task was started) |
| Latest environment verified | local sandbox (read-only) |
| Last full green gate | none (no gates exist — confirmed `UNKNOWN` baseline, not a failure) |
| Active blockers | none |
| Next eligible task | `CG-S3-ARCH-016` — Step 3 Closure Verification (Prompt 51) |

Checkpoint summary: Step 2 discovery closed prior. Step 3 has now produced 15 of 16 outputs, most recently `15_RISK_RANKED_CRITICAL_PATH.md`: a reproducible 9-dimension ordinal ranking method (unweighted sum, range 9–36) applied to the WBS/traceability-bound work; an 11-depth dependency-ordinal critical path (Phase 0 → Platform Core → Commercial → Operations/Portal basic → Finance → {Advanced TMS/WMS ∥ Procurement} → HRIS/Ticketing → Portal full/Loyalty → Intelligence/Enterprise → Hardening → Release/Go-Live → Direct GA); top-ranked risks RPD-022 Supreme Admin overlay (29), tenant isolation/RLS foundation (28), RPD-034/036 direct-GA convergence gate and configuration-engine guardrails (tie, 26), Finance posting integrity (25); one genuine parallel lane (Phase 5/6) plus five further concurrency lanes; accepted-risk overlay showing RPD-022/034/036/031/037/038 and the two Indonesia SME evidence gates (`FIN-195`, `HRT-282`) each visibly affecting sequencing/gate placement, surfacing that the two SME gates become hard GA blockers once combined with the all-modules-before-GA rule. No calendar dates or durations fabricated throughout. No new ADR candidate raised; no product decision was reopened; every claim is sourced. Repository remains 100% documentation.

## 2. Discovery and foundation readiness

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source and decision controls | `VERIFIED` (package) | `00-control/06_PACKAGE_BUILD_STATUS.md` | Product | All work |
| Repository discovery (14/14 prompts) | `VERIFIED` | `docs/discovery/14_STEP2_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` | Architecture | Feature code (still blocked pending Step 3) |
| Greenfield/brownfield decision | `VERIFIED` — `GREENFIELD`, High confidence | `docs/discovery/12_GREENFIELD_BROWNFIELD_DECISION.md` | Architecture | Target plan (now unblocked) |
| Environment/toolchain baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/03_TOOLCHAIN_DEPENDENCY_BASELINE.md` | DevEx | Reliable gates (pending Phase 0 build-out) |
| Database/migration baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/04_DATABASE_MIGRATION_BASELINE.md` | Data | Schema changes (pending Phase 0) |
| Security/access baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/06_SECURITY_BASELINE.md` | Security | Tenant features (pending Phase 0/1) |
| Test/performance/accessibility baseline | `VERIFIED` (`UNKNOWN` trust, absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/07,08,09_*.md` | QA | Before/after evidence (available once Phase 0 lands) |

Note: "`VERIFIED`" above means the discovery/audit task is complete and evidence-backed, not that the underlying capability is implemented — every capability remains `NOT_STARTED` at the product level (see §3–4).

## 3. Phase status

All rows are internal build/acceptance phases. No row alone authorizes external pilot or partial GA.

| Phase | Scope | Status | Completion | Next task |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Discovery and Foundation | `IN_PROGRESS` (discovery sub-phase done; Step 3 architecture sub-phase in progress) | ~48% (Step 2 done; Step 3 15/16 prompts done; Phase 0 foundation prompts 80–102 not started) | Step 3 architecture (Prompt 51), then Phase 0 foundation prompts |
| 1 | Platform Core | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_0_VERIFIED |
| 2 | Commercial | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_1_VERIFIED |
| 3 | Operations | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_2_VERIFIED |
| 4 | Finance | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_3_VERIFIED |
| 5 | Advanced TMS/WMS | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_4_VERIFIED |
| 6 | Procurement/Vendor | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_5_VERIFIED |
| 7 | HRIS/Ticketing | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_6_VERIFIED |
| 8 | Customer Portal/Loyalty | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_7_VERIFIED |
| 9 | Intelligence/Enterprise | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_8_VERIFIED |
| 15 | Full-system hardening | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_9_VERIFIED |
| 16 | RC and Go-live | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after hardening VERIFIED |

## 5. Current gate results

No executable gates exist (no toolchain). Lint/Typecheck/Unit/Build/DB/RLS/API/E2E/Performance-accessibility-security all `NOT_RUN` — absence of an application, not suppression.

## 6. Schema and deployment state

No environment deployed; no migration head. All environments `NOT_STARTED`. Production recovery: best effort per RPD-031/037 (no environment exists).

## 7. Blockers, errors, and known issues

| ID | Type | Severity | Scope | Workaround/recovery | Release effect | Ledger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ERR-2026-001 | Error (RESOLVED) | Sev-3 | Parallel-session merge corruption | Reconciled by CG-S2-DISC-001-R1; recurred a third time on a branch cut before `-R1` merged, resolved by this merge | none (cleared) | `ERROR_LEDGER.md` |
| ISS-2026-002 | Issue | Medium | No single-writer discipline across agent branches — **occurred twice** | One authoritative branch per runtime step (still not enforced) | Recurrence risk (demonstrated) | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| ISS-2026-003 | Risk | Medium (future) | No root `.gitignore` before scaffolding | Add before code | Safe secret/artifact handling | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| ISS-2026-001 | Issue (RESOLVED) | — | Source docs now tracked in `docs/blueprint/`; `tes.md` classified `CONFIRMED_PLACEHOLDER` (`PH-001`), pending owner-approved deletion | — | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |

## 8. Release-readiness summary

| Readiness domain | Status |
|---|---|
| All ten module suites | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Requirement traceability | `NOT_STARTED` (discovery-level evidence complete) |
| Tenant/security · Finance/data · E2E/regression · Migration/backup/DR · Performance/accessibility · Observability/docs | `NOT_STARTED` (baselines confirmed absent/`UNKNOWN`) |
| Go/no-go approval | `NOT_STARTED` |

External pilot is not a release stage. Direct GA requires the entire table `VERIFIED` with zero open Sev-1/critical defects.

## 9. Next action

- Next eligible task: `CG-S3-ARCH-016` — Step 3 Closure Verification.
- Entry conditions: `docs/architecture/15_RISK_RANKED_CRITICAL_PATH.md` `VERIFIED` (met); every critical-path/ranked item sourced, ranking reproducible, uncertainty explicit, no fabricated dates (met — §17 of that document).
- Required prompt/output: `03-architecture-and-plan/51_STEP3_CLOSURE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT.md` → `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`.
- If blocked, resume: re-read `docs/architecture/01_*.md` through `15_*.md` in full before starting Prompt 51.
- Authorized command: read-only inspection + `docs/architecture/**` writes only (Step 3 README §7).

## 10. Update rules

Update after every atomic task, rollback, gate change, blocker change, or checkpoint. Reconcile with `TASK_LEDGER.md`, build logs, change manifest, error/issue ledgers. Status is controlled by the evidence link.
