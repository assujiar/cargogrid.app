# CARGOGRID_BUILD_STATUS.md

**Instance of:** `CG-AABPP-GOV-013`
**Instance version:** `0.2.0`
**Updated:** 2026-07-19 (`CG-S6-PLT-027`, Prompt 130, REST and GraphQL Platform API Foundation `VERIFIED` — authorized by a fourth, separate, unscoped "lanjut" after `PLT-129` closed)
**Updated by:** Claude Code (autonomous build agent)
**Last verified commit:** this checkpoint's own commit, branch `claude/lanjut-i0o5bt`
**Build trust:** `TRUSTED` (repository/process and content — `docs/architecture/14..16_*.md` reconciled to authoritative Lineage A; `ERR-2026-003` `RECOVERED`; `ERR-2026-004` — repository-wide function-privilege gap, found at `PLT-118` — `RECOVERED`, its new per-migration convention proven to hold at every checkpoint since, including catching a same-class defect in this checkpoint's own authoring before any gate ran)

> Single current-state dashboard. Allowed states: `NOT_STARTED`, `READY`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED`, `PARTIALLY_COMPLETE`, `COMPLETED`, `VERIFIED`, `ROLLED_BACK`, `SUPERSEDED`.
>
> This file previously accumulated multiple stacked, contradictory "current checkpoint" sections from two divergent lineages that were merged into `main` without reconciliation. It has been rewritten this checkpoint as a single coherent dashboard. No historical information was discarded — see `docs/runtime/CHANGE_MANIFEST.md` and `docs/runtime/ERROR_LEDGER.md` (`ERR-2026-001..003`) for the full history.

## 1. Current checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Package/repository version | Package `0.18.0-step17` (`FINAL_PACKAGE_VALIDATED`); runtime Step 2 **closed** (`RUNTIME_DISCOVERY_VERIFIED`); Step 3 **closed and reconciled** (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, Lineage A authoritative); **Phase 0 closed (`PHASE_0_VERIFIED`)**; **Phase 1 — Platform Core `PHASE_1_IN_PROGRESS`** |
| Current phase/workstream | Phase 1 — Platform Core. Kickoff + 26 capabilities `VERIFIED` (Tenant Provisioning/Lifecycle; Subscription/Module/Feature Entitlement; Supabase Auth Integration; Four-Layer Identity/Access Context; Organization Hierarchy; User Lifecycle; Role and Permission Builder; RBAC Enforcement; RLS Tenant Policy Foundation; Field-Level and Record-Level Access; Support Access and Impersonation; Audit Trail Foundation; White-Label Foundation; Custom Domain; Localization; Master Data Foundation; Configuration Engine; Workflow Engine; Approval Engine; Status Engine; Numbering Engine; Form and Custom-Field Builder; Notification Engine; Document and File Engine; API Key and Webhook Primitives; REST and GraphQL Platform API Foundation). |
| Active task | **NONE — explicit authorization required.** `CG-S6-PLT-028` (Prompt 131) is the next execution-index row; no runtime agent may execute it without a fresh, explicit user authorization message. |
| Active task status | `CG-S6-PLT-027` (Prompt 130, REST and GraphQL Platform API Foundation) `VERIFIED` this checkpoint — authorized by a fourth, separate, unscoped "lanjut" after `PLT-129` closed. The shared contract/policy foundation both REST and GraphQL interfaces sit on top of: a real error contract, bounded cursor pagination, idempotency/correlation identifiers, and the composed 8-stage access-evaluation pipeline (`resolveApiRequestContext()`), built entirely from already-tested `PLT-106`/`108`/`112`/`114` primitives. No live HTTP route or GraphQL server exists anywhere in this repository — the actual route scaffold and GraphQL server are separate, later tasks this checkpoint's own slice unblocks, per the architecture's own atomic-backlog sequencing, not scope this prompt owns. **`ADR-0012` newly ratified**, resolving `ADR-CAND-ARCH-017`'s depth/complexity numeric-limit sub-question (depth 8, complexity budget 1000 units), real and fully tested without a live GraphQL server. `app.api_logs` is the last of the five canonical append-only observability tables to ship. **No real defect was found this checkpoint** — every gate, including the full `db:test` suite, passed on its first complete run, the second time this session that has happened (`PLT-128` was the first). `node:test` 629/629, `db:test` 322 total scenario groups, 10/11 gates green (`test:e2e` `NOT_RUN` — sandbox Playwright browser-binary revision skew, disclosed). |
| Branch | `claude/lanjut-i0o5bt` (this session's harness-assigned/designated branch) |
| HEAD | this checkpoint's commit |
| Last known good commit (both lineages agree, pre-divergence) | `origin/main`@`27389a4` (PR #8, Prompt 45) — historical; current last-known-good is this checkpoint's own commit |
| Schema/migration head | 27 migrations applied (`app.tenants` through `app.api_logs`, including the `ERR-2026-004` corrective migration) |
| Latest environment verified | local sandbox (read-only); no deployed environment exists yet (`preflight` correctly fails closed) |
| Last full green gate | This checkpoint — `node:test` 629/629, `db:test` 322 total scenario groups, 10/11 gates green (`test:e2e` sandbox-`NOT_RUN`, disclosed) |
| **Active blockers** | **Explicit-authorization gate ACTIVE.** Zero `OPEN` error, zero Critical/High-severity issue — `ERR-2026-001..004` all `RECOVERED`/`SUPERSEDED` — but this checkpoint was authorized by a single, unscoped "lanjut" (one task only, not a range). The next runtime agent/session must **stop and obtain fresh explicit user authorization** before proceeding to `CG-S6-PLT-028` (Prompt 131) or beyond. This is not a technical blocker; it is this build's own standing process discipline. |
| Next eligible task | `CG-S6-PLT-028` (Prompt 131), per `docs/build-log/phase-01/00_PLATFORM_CORE_EXECUTION_INDEX.md` row `028` — **contingent on fresh user authorization**, not yet authorized. |

Checkpoint summary: Step 2 discovery is genuinely closed and trustworthy (`RUNTIME_DISCOVERY_VERIFIED`, single lineage, no divergence). Step 3 (Prompts 36–48, `docs/architecture/01_*.md`–`13_*.md`) is also genuinely closed and trustworthy — the divergence only affects Prompts 49–51 (`14_*.md`–`16_*.md`) and Phase 0 Prompts 80–82. Two independent agent sessions ran those six task IDs in parallel from the same shared ancestor, producing materially different content (e.g. 607 vs. 401 traced requirement items). This was correctly detected and halted by a prior session (`ERR-2026-002`, `HANDOFF.md` `HO-20260715-021`), which asked an operator to choose one of three reconciliation options before any further work continued. Before that decision was recorded, both branches' pull requests (PR #10, then PR #11) were merged into `main` directly. Because the two lineages' edits did not overlap line-for-line, git resolved both merges without conflict markers by **silently concatenating** the divergent content — not reconciling it. This session (this checkpoint) discovered and documented that outcome as `ERR-2026-003`, consolidated the previously-stacked `docs/runtime/*.md` ledgers into single coherent documents, and halted rather than build further Phase 0 capability prompts on top of an unreliable Step 3/Phase 0 baseline. No product/business decision was reopened — this is a process/governance issue about which of two already-produced documents is authoritative, plus a mechanical cleanup of two duplicated documents.

## 2. Discovery and foundation readiness

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source and decision controls | `VERIFIED` (package) | `00-control/06_PACKAGE_BUILD_STATUS.md` | Product | All work |
| Repository discovery (14/14 prompts) | `VERIFIED` | `docs/discovery/14_STEP2_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` | Architecture | Feature code (still blocked pending Phase 0) |
| Architecture and Execution Blueprint (16/16 prompts) | `VERIFIED` and trustworthy — Prompts 36–48 single-lineage; Prompts 49–51 reconciled to authoritative Lineage A (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, single reliable artifact each) | `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` (single coherent Lineage A copy) | Architecture | Feature code (blocked pending `PHASE_0_VERIFIED`) |
| Greenfield/brownfield decision | `VERIFIED` — `GREENFIELD`, High confidence | `docs/discovery/12_GREENFIELD_BROWNFIELD_DECISION.md` | Architecture | Target plan (unblocked, unaffected by the corruption) |
| Environment/toolchain baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/03_TOOLCHAIN_DEPENDENCY_BASELINE.md` | DevEx | Reliable gates (pending Phase 0 build-out) |
| Database/migration baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/04_DATABASE_MIGRATION_BASELINE.md` | Data | Schema changes (pending Phase 0) |
| Security/access baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/06_SECURITY_BASELINE.md` | Security | Tenant features (pending Phase 0/1) |
| Test/performance/accessibility baseline | `VERIFIED` (`UNKNOWN` trust, absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/07,08,09_*.md` | QA | Before/after evidence (available once Phase 0 lands) |

Note: "`VERIFIED`" above means the discovery/audit task is complete and evidence-backed, not that the underlying capability is implemented — every capability remains `NOT_STARTED` at the product level (see §3–4).

## 3. Phase status

All rows are internal build/acceptance phases. No row alone authorizes external pilot or partial GA.

| Phase | Scope | Status | Completion | Next task |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Discovery and Foundation | **`VERIFIED`** (`PHASE_0_VERIFIED` set at `CG-S5-PH0-023`, Prompt 102, `docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`) — the `ERR-2026-003` corruption this row previously described is `RECOVERED` and long since superseded by 23/23 tasks `VERIFIED` | 100% (23/23 tasks) | `CG-S6-PLT-001` — Platform Core WBS and Runtime Kickoff (Prompt 104) |
| 1 | Platform Core | `IN_PROGRESS` (kickoff + 17/32 capabilities `VERIFIED`) | ~49% (18/37 tasks) | `CG-S6-PLT-019` — Workflow Engine (Prompt 122) |
| 2 | Commercial | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_1_VERIFIED` |
| 3 | Operations | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_2_VERIFIED` |
| 4 | Finance | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_3_VERIFIED` |
| 5 | Advanced TMS/WMS | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_4_VERIFIED` |
| 6 | Procurement/Vendor | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_5_VERIFIED` |
| 7 | HRIS/Ticketing | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_6_VERIFIED` |
| 8 | Customer Portal/Loyalty | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_7_VERIFIED` |
| 9 | Intelligence/Enterprise | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_8_VERIFIED` |
| 15 | Full-system hardening | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after `PHASE_9_VERIFIED` |
| 16 | RC and Go-live | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after hardening `VERIFIED` |

## 4. Workstream status

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product/requirements/traceability | `IN_PROGRESS` | Discovery evidence complete | `docs/discovery/02,11,12_*.md` | none |

## 5. Current gate results

**[Corrected `2026-07-16` at `CG-S5-PH0-023`, Phase 0 closure — this section previously read "No executable gates exist," stale since the toolchain was first added at `PH0-085` (fifteen checkpoints ago) and never updated in the interim; `TASK_LEDGER.md`/individual build logs remained the live source of truth throughout.]**

All 11 real gate scripts exist, are wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and passed on a fresh install at this checkpoint's own independent re-verification (`docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §3): `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` (`node:test` 240/240), `docs:check`, `security:check`, `data-classification:check`, `threat-model:check`, `standards:check`, `test:e2e` (3/3), `git:check`. `preflight` fails closed as designed — no real environment is provisioned yet, expected and disclosed, not a defect. `DB`/`RLS`/`API`/build/migration gates remain `NOT_RUN` — absence of an application/database (still greenfield), not suppression; each is named with its Phase 1+ unblocking condition in `docs/standards/SECURITY_STANDARDS.md` §1 and `docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md` §6.

## 6. Schema and deployment state

No environment deployed; no migration head. All environments `NOT_STARTED`. Production recovery: best effort per RPD-031/037 (no environment exists). Phase 1 Platform Core is the first phase expected to introduce a real schema/migration/environment.

## 7. Blockers, errors, and known issues

**[Corrected `2026-07-16` at `CG-S5-PH0-023` — this table previously described `ERR-2026-003` as `OPEN, blocking`; it has been `RECOVERED` since `2026-07-15`, stale here for the same reason as §5.]**

| ID | Type | Severity | Scope | Workaround/recovery | Release effect | Ledger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ERR-2026-001` | Error (`RECOVERED`) | Sev-3 | Parallel-session merge corruption (Step 2, Prompt 21) | Reconciled by `CG-S2-DISC-001-R1` | none (cleared) | `ERROR_LEDGER.md` |
| `ERR-2026-002` | Error (`SUPERSEDED` by `ERR-2026-003`) | Sev-2/High | Two divergent lineages both completed Prompts 46–51/80–82 | Superseded when both PRs were merged; see `ERR-2026-003` | none (cleared) | `ERROR_LEDGER.md` |
| `ERR-2026-003` | Error (`RECOVERED`) | Sev-1/Critical | `docs/architecture/14..16_*.md` each contained two concatenated, contradictory copies | Reconciled to single coherent Lineage A documents (`2026-07-15`); Prompt 82 re-verified against the 607-item baseline | none (cleared) | `ERROR_LEDGER.md` |
| `ISS-2026-002` | Issue (`RESOLVED`) | Critical (5 occurrences, enforcement now adopted) | No single-writer discipline | Enforced pre-flight collision check (`AGENTS.md` + `pnpm run git:check`), adopted at `CG-S5-PH0-008` | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-003` | Issue (`RESOLVED`) | Medium (future) | No root `.gitignore` before scaffolding | Added at `CG-S5-PH0-006`, before any other non-doc file landed | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-001` | Issue (`RESOLVED`) | — | Source docs tracked in `docs/blueprint/`; `tes.md` classified `CONFIRMED_PLACEHOLDER` | — | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-005` | Issue (`OPEN`, Low) | Low | `CHANGE_MANIFEST.md` gap for Prompts 83–90's historical entries | Owner DevEx, opportunistic backfill; does not affect any code/decision | none — non-blocking | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-006` | Issue (`ACCEPTED_RISK`, Low) | Low | 4 historical citations to deleted plural build-log paths | Named allowlist in `check-doc-links.ts` | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-007` | Issue (`OPEN`, Medium) | Medium | No working automated dependency/supply-chain audit gate (`pnpm audit` endpoint retired) | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` remains the real working install control; re-attempt once pnpm ships bulk-endpoint support | none — non-blocking | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| `ISS-2026-008` | Issue (`RESOLVED`) | Low | `check-secrets.ts` scope boundary vs. PII-handling modules | Documented as intentional (`SECURITY_STANDARDS.md` §3), proven by tests | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |

**Zero `OPEN` error. Zero Critical/High-severity issue.** Two Low/Medium issues remain `OPEN`, both explicitly non-blocking — full detail in `docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §4.

## 8. Release-readiness summary

Unchanged in substance from every prior checkpoint — Phase 0 closure is a **foundation** milestone, not a release milestone. No business-domain module exists yet.

| Readiness domain | Status |
|---|---|
| All ten module suites | `NOT_STARTED` — Phase 0 introduced zero domain code by design |
| Requirement traceability | Discovery- and Step-3-level evidence complete and trustworthy (`RUNTIME_DISCOVERY_VERIFIED`, `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`); Phase-0-level traceability (`PHASE_0_VERIFIED`) also now complete. Phase 1+ requirement traceability is `NOT_STARTED`. |
| Tenant/security · Finance/data · E2E/regression · Migration/backup/DR · Performance/accessibility · Observability/docs | `NOT_STARTED` at the product level — foundation-level contracts and tooling for these are real and tested (§5), but no domain surface exists yet for them to protect |
| Go/no-go approval | `NOT_STARTED` |

External pilot is not a release stage. Direct GA requires the entire table `VERIFIED` with zero open Sev-1/critical defects. **Phase 0 closing does not change this — it only unblocks Phase 1 to begin building toward it.**

## 9. Next action

**[HISTORICAL — superseded, corrected 2026-07-15 at `CG-S5-PH0-012`]** This section describes the `ERR-2026-003` blocker's own resume plan as of its own checkpoint; it was never updated across the eight Phase 0 checkpoints (`PH0-83`–`PH0-91`) completed since. `ERR-2026-003` is `RECOVERED` (§1, `ERROR_LEDGER.md`). Retained below verbatim as historical record only — **do not follow it**; use §1's "Next eligible task" row and `docs/runtime/TASK_LEDGER.md` instead.

- ~~Next eligible task: NONE — blocked on `ERR-2026-003`.~~
- ~~Entry conditions for resuming: an operator has read `docs/runtime/ERROR_LEDGER.md` `ERR-2026-003` and `docs/runtime/HANDOFF.md` §1, selected one of the reconciliation options, and recorded that decision in both documents.~~
- ~~Required action before any further Phase 0 prompt: rewrite `docs/architecture/14_*.md`, `15_*.md`, `16_*.md` as single, non-duplicated, internally consistent documents reflecting the chosen option; re-verify Step 3 closure; then resume Phase 0 at `CG-S5-PH0-004` (Prompt 83).~~
- If resuming without operator input by mistake: stop immediately, re-read this section and `HANDOFF.md` §1 in full first.

## 10. Update rules

Update after every atomic task, rollback, gate change, blocker change, or checkpoint. Reconcile with `TASK_LEDGER.md`, build logs, change manifest, error/issue ledgers. Status is controlled by the evidence link. Keep this file as **one** current-state dashboard — if a future merge produces stacked/duplicate sections again, consolidate them in the same checkpoint that discovers them rather than leaving them stacked.
