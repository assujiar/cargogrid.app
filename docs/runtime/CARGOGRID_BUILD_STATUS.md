## 1. Current checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Package/repository version | Package `0.18.0-step17` (`FINAL_PACKAGE_VALIDATED`); runtime Step 2 **closed**; Step 3 **CLOSED** (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, 16/16); Phase 0 **IN_PROGRESS** (2/22 downstream prompts) |
| Current phase/workstream | Phase 0 — Discovery and Foundation (`PHASE_0_IN_PROGRESS`) |
| Active task | `CG-S5-PH0-002` — Source Alignment and Context Bootstrap (Prompt 81) |
| Active task status | `VERIFIED` — `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-002_source_alignment_context_bootstrap.md` complete |
| Branch | `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` (continuation branch; picked up `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build`'s 3 unmerged commits by merge; cut from `origin/main`@`39d923e`) |
| HEAD | this checkpoint's commit on `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` |
| Last known good commit | `origin/main`@`39d923e` |
| Schema/migration head | NONE (no database — this checkpoint is a context-bootstrap/verification task, no foundation change performed) |
| Latest environment verified | local sandbox (read-only) |
| Last full green gate | none (no gates exist — confirmed `UNKNOWN` baseline, not a failure) |
| Active blockers | none |
| Next eligible task | `CG-S5-PH0-003` — Requirement Traceability Baseline (Prompt 82) |

Checkpoint summary: Step 2 discovery closed prior; **Step 3 (Architecture and Execution Blueprint) fully closed** (`RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`, 16/16 outputs). **Phase 0 — Discovery and Foundation underway** (kickoff `CG-S5-PH0-001` `VERIFIED`; `CG-S5-PH0-002` now also `VERIFIED`). Prompt 81 materialized the approved source hierarchy/decisions/status into repository-native context: `CARGOGRID_CONTEXT.md` §2 now explicitly cites the `GOV-010..019` governance-instance register (10 template IDs mapped to their repository-native files, all verified by direct header read, zero mismatch); a fresh-context reconstruction test (a hypothetical fresh agent reading `AGENTS.md`→`CARGOGRID_CONTEXT.md`→`CARGOGRID_BUILD_STATUS.md`→`TASK_LEDGER.md`→`HANDOFF.md` can reconstruct full product/repository/checkpoint state without chat history) passed with no gap found. No application/test/config/migration/database/environment file was touched. `PH0-082` (Requirement Traceability Baseline) now `READY`. Repository remains 100% documentation outside `docs/build-logs/**`.

**Branch note (carried forward):** the session's designated continuation branch is `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`, not `agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build`. Earlier in this run, `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` was reconciled to `origin/main`@`27389a4` (PR #8 already merged) while `origin/agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build` carried 3 further unmerged commits (Prompts 46–48). Those were merged forward into `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6` (no conflicts, content-identical), so no progress was lost. All checkpoints continue on `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`.

## 2. Discovery and foundation readiness

| Gate | Status | Evidence | Owner | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source and decision controls | `VERIFIED` (package) | `00-control/06_PACKAGE_BUILD_STATUS.md` | Product | All work |
| Repository discovery (14/14 prompts) | `VERIFIED` | `docs/discovery/14_STEP2_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` | Architecture | Feature code (still blocked pending Phase 0) |
| Architecture and Execution Blueprint (16/16 prompts) | `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED` | `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` | Architecture | Feature code (still blocked pending `PHASE_0_VERIFIED`) |
| Greenfield/brownfield decision | `VERIFIED` — `GREENFIELD`, High confidence | `docs/discovery/12_GREENFIELD_BROWNFIELD_DECISION.md` | Architecture | Target plan (now unblocked) |
| Environment/toolchain baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/03_TOOLCHAIN_DEPENDENCY_BASELINE.md` | DevEx | Reliable gates (pending Phase 0 build-out) |
| Database/migration baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/04_DATABASE_MIGRATION_BASELINE.md` | Data | Schema changes (pending Phase 0) |
| Security/access baseline | `VERIFIED` (absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/06_SECURITY_BASELINE.md` | Security | Tenant features (pending Phase 0/1) |
| Test/performance/accessibility baseline | `VERIFIED` (`UNKNOWN` trust, absence confirmed) | `docs/discovery/07,08,09_*.md` | QA | Before/after evidence (available once Phase 0 lands) |

Note: "`VERIFIED`" above means the discovery/audit task is complete and evidence-backed, not that the underlying capability is implemented — every capability remains `NOT_STARTED` at the product level (see §3–4).

## 3. Phase status

All rows are internal build/acceptance phases. No row alone authorizes external pilot or partial GA.

| Phase | Scope | Status | Completion | Next task |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Discovery and Foundation | `IN_PROGRESS` (discovery sub-phase done; Step 3 architecture sub-phase `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED`; Phase 0 foundation-build sub-phase 2/22 downstream prompts done) | ~60% (Step 2 done; Step 3 done 16/16; Phase 0 kickoff + context bootstrap done, capability prompts 82–102 not started) | Phase 0: `82_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY_BASELINE_PROMPT.md` |
| 1 | Platform Core | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_0_VERIFIED |
| 2 | Commercial | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_1_VERIFIED |

| 9 | Intelligence/Enterprise | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_8_VERIFIED |
| 15 | Full-system hardening | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after PHASE_9_VERIFIED |
| 16 | RC and Go-live | `NOT_STARTED` | 0% | after hardening VERIFIED |

## 5. Current gate results

No executable gates exist (no toolchain). Lint/Typecheck/Unit/Build/DB/RLS/API/E2E/Performance-accessibility-security all `NOT_RUN` — absence of an application, not suppression.

## 6. Schema and deployment state

No environment deployed; no migration head. All environments `NOT_STARTED`. Production recovery: best effort per RPD-031/037 (no environment exists).

## 7. Blockers, errors, and known issues

| ID | Type | Severity | Scope | Workaround/recovery | Release effect | Ledger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ERR-2026-001 | Error (RESOLVED) | Sev-3 | Parallel-session merge corruption | Reconciled by CG-S2-DISC-001-R1; recurred a third time on a branch cut before `-R1` merged, resolved by this merge | none (cleared) | `ERROR_LEDGER.md` |
| ISS-2026-002 | Issue | Medium | No single-writer discipline across agent branches — **occurred twice** | One authoritative branch per runtime step (still not enforced) | Recurrence risk (demonstrated) | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| ISS-2026-003 | Risk | Medium (future) | No root `.gitignore` before scaffolding | Add before code | Safe secret/artifact handling | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| ISS-2026-001 | Issue (RESOLVED) | — | Source docs now tracked in `docs/blueprint/`; `tes.md` classified `CONFIRMED_PLACEHOLDER` (`PH-001`), pending owner-approved deletion | — | none | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |

## 8. Release-readiness summary

| Readiness domain | Status |
|---|---|
| All ten module suites | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Requirement traceability | `NOT_STARTED` (discovery-level evidence complete) |
| Tenant/security · Finance/data · E2E/regression · Migration/backup/DR · Performance/accessibility · Observability/docs | `NOT_STARTED` (baselines confirmed absent/`UNKNOWN`) |
| Go/no-go approval | `NOT_STARTED` |

External pilot is not a release stage. Direct GA requires the entire table `VERIFIED` with zero open Sev-1/critical defects.

## 9. Next action

- Next eligible task: `CG-S5-PH0-003` — Requirement Traceability Baseline (Prompt 82).
- Entry conditions: `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md` marks `PH0-082` `READY` (met — `PH0-081` `VERIFIED` this checkpoint).
- Required prompt/output: `05-phase-00-discovery-foundation/82_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY_BASELINE_PROMPT.md` → per that prompt's own required-output field (confirm exact path when executing; do not assume).
- If blocked, resume: re-read `docs/build-logs/CG-S5-PH0-001_phase0_execution_index.md`/`_phase0_wbs.md` and `CG-S5-PH0-002_source_alignment_context_bootstrap.md` in full, then `82_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY_BASELINE_PROMPT.md`, before continuing Phase 0 work.
- Authorized command: read-only inspection + `docs/runtime/**`/`docs/build-logs/**` writes per `PH0-082`'s allowed-path list (traceability/governance/build-log/validation-script paths); later Phase 0 capabilities (`085`+) authorize toolchain/environment/CI scaffolding outside `docs/` — confirm each capability's own allowed-path list before writing outside `docs/`.

## 10. Update rules

Update after every atomic task, rollback, gate change, blocker change, or checkpoint. Reconcile with `TASK_LEDGER.md`, build logs, change manifest, error/issue ledgers. Status is controlled by the evidence link.
