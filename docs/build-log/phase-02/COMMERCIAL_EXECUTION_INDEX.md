# Commercial Execution Index

**Prompt:** `CG-S7-COM-001` (`CG-AABPP-COM-142` v0.8.0)
**Runtime output of:** `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/07-phase-02-commercial/142_COMMERCIAL_WBS_RUNTIME_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
**Status:** `PHASE_2_IN_PROGRESS` — updated at `COM-146` (CRM Sales Plan and Pipeline, `VERIFIED`); this document itself remains index/planning only and performs no Commercial-domain runtime source/schema change (each capability's own migration/code lives in its own commit, cited per row)

## 0. Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `assujiar/cargogrid.app` |
| Working branch | `claude/lanjut-c6vqse`, tracked, no open PR |
| HEAD at authoring time (pre-commit) | `6293269` (merge of PR #17, `CG-S6-PLT-037`/Prompt 140, Platform Core Closure Verification — `PHASE_1_VERIFIED` set) |
| Worktree state | Clean except this document, its sibling `00_COMMERCIAL_WBS.md`, the new `docs/adr/ADR-0015-*.md`, and the runtime-ledger updates (`HANDOFF.md`, `CARGOGRID_BUILD_STATUS.md`, `TASK_LEDGER.md`, `docs/adr/README.md`) this same checkpoint makes |
| Repository state | Unchanged application/schema surface: zero Commercial-domain migration, table, route, or UI file exists or was touched by this task. `app/(tenant)/[tenantSlug]/commercial/` does not exist yet — this kickoff does not create it (that is `143`'s own first task). |
| Mutation performed by this document | **NONE** — index/planning only; this task's only writes are the two new `docs/build-log/phase-02/` files, the new ADR, and the runtime ledger/register updates listed above |
| Pre-flight collision check | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (state `open`): `[]` — zero open PRs. Every remote branch (`agent/cargogrid-autonomous-build`, `claude/cargogrid-ai-agent-setup-{b492y3,oanf5a}`, `claude/eloquent-mayer-s40hn4`, `claude/lanjut-{0kwbyt,btusq6,i0o5bt}`, `claude/sleepy-ride-4vxsk6`, `codex/extract-zip-contents-to-target-folder`) checked via `git log origin/main..origin/<branch>` — all empty, i.e. fully contained in `main`, zero unmerged work anywhere. `claude/lanjut-c6vqse`'s own prior remote ref was already deleted (this session's branch had no prior push); recreated locally from `origin/main`@`6293269`. |
| User authorization | A fresh, explicit, open-ended "lanjut" was confirmed via `AskUserQuestion` this checkpoint (option selected: "Start Phase 2, open-ended") — satisfying `HANDOFF.md`'s standing rule that closing Phase 1 does not itself authorize starting Phase 2 |

## 1. Runtime entry gate verification (required task, per `142_*.md` "Mandatory entry gate")

| # | Condition | Verified | Evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `RUNTIME_DISCOVERY_VERIFIED` | ✔ | `docs/discovery/14_STEP2_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §9 — unchanged since Phase 0, re-confirmed at every subsequent phase closure |
| 2 | `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED` | ✔ | `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §10 (Lineage A, `ERR-2026-003` `RECOVERED`) |
| 3 | `PHASE_0_VERIFIED` | ✔ | `docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §7 |
| 4 | `PHASE_1_VERIFIED` at the active repository/schema/environment checkpoint | ✔ | `docs/build-log/phase-01/PLATFORM_CORE_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` — set at `CG-S6-PLT-037` (Prompt 140), commit `6293269` (this checkpoint's own immediately-prior HEAD, confirmed by direct `git log`) |
| 5 | Step 4 reusable templates are package-verified | ✔ | `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/00-control/06_PACKAGE_BUILD_STATUS.md` line 29 — 27/27 files, 25 operational templates; package-generation state, distinct from runtime execution |
| 6 | Commercial WBS/traceability, branch/worktree ownership, exact paths, environment, baselines and downstream contracts are current | ✔ (branch/worktree/environment, §0 above); **being established by this document** (WBS/traceability — this document plus `00_COMMERCIAL_WBS.md` are the artifact this condition asks for, the identical bootstrapping pattern Platform Core's own `PLT-104` used) |

**Result: entry gate PASS.** All six conditions hold at the current active checkpoint. `PHASE_2_BLOCKED` is not warranted.

## 2. Reconciliation with the master WBS Commercial row

`docs/architecture/13_FULL_WORK_BREAKDOWN_STRUCTURE.md` §2/§4 already assigns the authoritative Commercial capability-ID range and gate pair (`COM` short-code, `CG-WBS-141`–`165`):

| Field | Master WBS value | This index |
|---|---|---|
| README (Epic) | `COM-141` | Reconciled — `141_COMMERCIAL_README.md`, read in full |
| Kickoff (Workstream entry) | `COM-142` | Reconciled — this document is `142`'s runtime output |
| Capability/Feature-slice range | `COM-143..161` | Reconciled — 19 capabilities, one row per prompt in §3 of this document |
| Verification | `COM-162` | Reconciled |
| Hardening | `COM-163` | Reconciled |
| Documentation | `COM-164` | Reconciled |
| Closure | `COM-165` | Reconciled |
| Entry gate | `PHASE_1_VERIFIED` | Confirmed at this checkpoint (§1 above) |
| Exit gate | `PHASE_2_VERIFIED` | Only `165` may set this state (per `141_*.md` §6) |

No second numbering scheme is introduced. This index adopts the package's own `CG-S7-COM-<NNN>` runtime-ID scheme (mapped linearly as `CG-S7-COM-(file# − 141)`, confirmed by direct grep of every capability prompt file's own `Prompt ID` line this checkpoint: `142`→`001`, `143`→`002`, `161`→`020`, `165`→`024`). The short-hand `COM-<file#>` (e.g. `COM-149`) is used interchangeably, matching `13_*.md`'s own column headers and `141_*.md`'s own table.

Full capability-catalogue and dependency-order reconciliation (WBS/traceability/schema-ownership/API-UI-boundary/ADR reconciliation) is performed in `00_COMMERCIAL_WBS.md` §2–§3, not duplicated here.

## 3. Full execution index

Hierarchy column format: `Workstream / Epic`, derived from `00_COMMERCIAL_WBS.md` §2's grouping (itself derived verbatim from each capability prompt's own §3 "Workstream"/"Epic" line, not invented). Status is `READY` only where every prerequisite task is already `VERIFIED`; otherwise `BLOCKED`, with the exact missing evidence named.

**Tally (updated at `COM-146`, row `005` — CRM Sales Plan and Pipeline `VERIFIED`):** of the 24 rows in this index (`142`–`165`), **5 are `VERIFIED`** (kickoff, Lead Management, Prospect Lifecycle, Contact and Activity Management, CRM Sales Plan and Pipeline) and **1 is `READY`** (`147`, Opportunity Management — its dependency, `144..146`, now `VERIFIED`). The remaining 18 rows are `BLOCKED` on their own not-yet-started predecessor. [Historical: at `COM-145`'s own checkpoint, the tally was 4 `VERIFIED`, 1 `READY`, 19 `BLOCKED` — retained here only as a superseded data point, not current state.]

## 4. Collision inspection (required task 7)

| Surface | Inspected | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Worktree | `git status --short --branch` | Clean at HEAD `6293269` except this task's own new files (§0) |
| Branches/PRs | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (state `open`); `git log origin/main..origin/<branch>` for every remote branch | `[]` open PRs; zero unmerged commits on any remote branch — full detail in §0 |
| Migrations | `supabase/migrations/` listing | 36 migrations as of `COM-146` (32 Platform Core-scoped plus `20260723090000_create_commercial_lead_management.sql` (`COM-143`), `20260723120000_create_commercial_prospect_lifecycle.sql` (`COM-144`), `20260723150000_create_commercial_contact_activity_management.sql` (`COM-145`), and `20260723180000_create_commercial_sales_pipeline.sql` (`COM-146`), all additive only — `COM-146`'s migration also carries one corrective `CREATE OR REPLACE` of `app.can_access_record`, `PLT-114`, disclosed in `COM-146.md` §3.6/§8). `149` will be the next Commercial task to add a migration (extending, not competing with, `PLT-120`'s existing `vendor_rate` master-data registration, per `ADR-0015`). |
| Schema | `05_DATABASE_SCHEMA_WORKSTREAM.md` §3/§4 | Single `app` schema, unchanged — no Opportunity/Costing/Quotation table exists yet. No collision possible at this checkpoint. |
| Application code | `git ls-files app/ lib/ server/ components/ \| grep -iE "customer\|lead\|prospect\|contact\|activit\|pipeline\|quote\|opportunity"` | As of `COM-146`: real, expected matches under `app/(tenant)/[tenantSlug]/commercial/{leads,prospects,contacts,pipeline}/`, `server/{contracts,queries,mutations}/{lead,prospect,contact,pipeline}*` — the scope `143`/`144`/`145`/`146`'s own prompts authorize. Zero match for `customer`/`quote`/`opportunity` — those remain out of scope until their own capability prompts (`147`, `151`, `155`) run. |
| `docs/build-log/phase-02/` (new directory) | Directory listing | Contains exactly this file and `00_COMMERCIAL_WBS.md`, both newly created by this task. No pre-existing content to collide with. |

**Result: zero file/schema/environment collision found.** `147` (Opportunity Management) is dependency-`READY` and may proceed under this session's own open-ended authorization.
