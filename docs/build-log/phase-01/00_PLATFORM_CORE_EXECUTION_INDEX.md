# 00 — Platform Core Execution Index

**Prompt:** `CG-S6-PLT-001` (`CG-AABPP-PLT-104` v0.7.0)
**Runtime output of:** `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/06-phase-01-platform-core/104_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS_RUNTIME_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
**Status:** `PHASE_1_IN_PROGRESS` (kickoff/index only — no capability task `105`–`140` has executed; this document performs no runtime source/schema change)

| Pre-flight collision check | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (state `open`): `[]` — zero open PRs. `pnpm run git:check`: no local collision risk, branch name valid, worktree clean at start. |

## 1. Runtime entry gate verification (required task 1)

Per `103_PLATFORM_CORE_README.md` §2, five conditions gate Prompt 104 and all operational Prompts `105`–`139`:

| # | Condition | Verified | Evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Step 2 runtime discovery is `RUNTIME_DISCOVERY_VERIFIED` | ✔ | `docs/discovery/14_STEP2_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §9. Unchanged since Phase 0's own repeated re-confirmation at every checkpoint this session (`PH0-83.md` through `PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §2.1). |
| 2 | Step 3 runtime architecture is `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_VERIFIED` | ✔ | `docs/architecture/16_STEP3_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §10 (Lineage A, reconciled from `ERR-2026-003`, `RECOVERED`). |
| 3 | Step 5 runtime closure is `PHASE_0_VERIFIED` at the active repository checkpoint | ✔ | `docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §7 — `PHASE_0_VERIFIED` set at `CG-S5-PH0-023` (Prompt 102), commit `c6b08f5`, this session's own immediately-prior checkpoint. Independently re-verified there against fresh evidence (fresh install, all 11 gates green, zero open Critical/High issue/error) — re-confirmed here by direct re-grep of `docs/runtime/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`/`ERROR_LEDGER.md` at this checkpoint's own start: still zero `OPEN` error, still only `ISS-2026-005`/`ISS-2026-007` open (both Low/Medium, non-blocking, unchanged). |
| 4 | Step 4 reusable library is package-verified | ✔ | `docs/ai-agent-build-prompt-package/00-control/06_PACKAGE_BUILD_STATUS.md` line 29: "Step 4 reusable-library files `VERIFIED` — 27/27; 25 operational templates." Package-generation state, explicitly distinct from runtime execution — same package-vs-runtime distinction discipline every prior kickoff document in this repository applies. |
| 5 | Phase 1 WBS/traceability, branch/worktree ownership, exact paths, environment and baselines are current | ✔ (task authority/ownership/environment); **being established by this document** (WBS/traceability) | Branch/worktree ownership: `claude/lanjut-btusq6`, single-writer, zero open PR (this checkpoint's own pre-flight, §0 above). Environment: pnpm `10.33.0`/Node `>=22.11.0` toolchain real and tested since `PH0-085`, 11 real gate scripts green (`docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §3) — this is Phase 0's own deliverable, inherited unchanged, not re-established here. WBS/traceability: this document plus `00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` **are** the artifact this condition asks for — satisfied by this checkpoint's own output, the identical bootstrapping pattern Phase 0's own Prompt 80/`00_PHASE0_EXECUTION_INDEX.md` §1 condition 5 used. |

**Result: entry gate PASS.** All five conditions hold at the current active checkpoint (`c6b08f5`, `claude/lanjut-btusq6`). `PHASE_1_BLOCKED` is not warranted.

## 2. Reconciliation with the master WBS Platform Core row (required task 1/2)

`docs/architecture/13_FULL_WORK_BREAKDOWN_STRUCTURE.md` §4 line 67 already assigns the authoritative Platform Core capability-ID range and gate pair:

| Field | `13_*.md` §4 value | This index |
|---|---|---|
| README (Epic) | `PLT-103` | Reconciled — `103_PLATFORM_CORE_README.md`, read in full |
| Kickoff (Workstream entry) | `PLT-104` | Reconciled — this document is `PLT-104`'s runtime output |
| Capability/Feature-slice range | `PLT-105..136` | Reconciled — 32 capabilities, one row per prompt in §3 of this document |
| Verification | `PLT-137` | Reconciled |
| Hardening | `PLT-138` | Reconciled |
| Documentation | `PLT-139` | Reconciled |
| Closure | `PLT-140` | Reconciled |
| Entry gate | `PHASE_0_VERIFIED` | Confirmed at this checkpoint (§1 above) |
| Exit gate | `PHASE_1_VERIFIED` | Only `PLT-140` may set this state (per `103_*.md` §6) |

No second numbering scheme is introduced. This index adopts the package's own `CG-S6-PLT-<NNN>` runtime-ID scheme (verified present in every one of the 37 prompt files' own header, `104` through `140`, mapped linearly as `CG-S6-PLT-(file# − 103)` — confirmed by direct grep of every file's `Prompt ID` line this checkpoint: `104`→`001`, `105`→`002`, `136`→`033`, `140`→`037`). The short-hand `PLT-<file#>` (e.g. `PLT-105`) is used interchangeably in the table below, matching `13_*.md` §4's own column headers and `103_*.md` §4's own table.

Full capability-catalogue and dependency-order reconciliation (required task 2 — modules/preserved-assets/schema-ownership/API-UI-boundary/ADR reconciliation) is performed in `00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` §3, not duplicated here.

## 3. Full execution index (required tasks 3, 4, 5)

Hierarchy column format: `Workstream / Epic / Capability`, derived from `00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` §2's grouping (itself derived from `01_MODULE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md` §2.1's 18 platform primitives, not invented). Status is `READY` only where every prerequisite task is already `VERIFIED`; otherwise `BLOCKED`, with the exact missing evidence named. Allowed-path/DB-impact summaries are reproduced verbatim from each prompt's own §11/§13 (`00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` §3 carries the full per-row detail; this table carries the operational status columns).

**Tally (updated at `PLT-133`, row `030`):** of the 37 rows in this index (`104`–`140`), **30 are `VERIFIED`** (`104`–`133`, kickoff plus 29 capabilities), **1 is `READY`** (`PLT-134`, dependency-satisfied, pending fresh explicit user authorization per this build's own standing discipline — see `docs/runtime/HANDOFF.md`), and **6 are `BLOCKED`** (`135`–`140`, each for the identical, expected reason — an upstream capability task in its own dependency chain, `00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` §3/§6, has not yet reached `VERIFIED`). No task is `BLOCKED` for a missing-evidence or unresolved-ADR reason. [Historical: at this index's own authoring checkpoint (`PLT-104`), the tally was 1 `READY` (`PLT-105`) and 35 `BLOCKED` — retained here only as a superseded data point, not current state; the one still-open Platform Core-scoped item from that checkpoint (`server/contracts/` folder timing) was resolved as a WBS convention there (`00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md` §3).]

## 4. Collision inspection (required task 5)

| Surface | Inspected | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Worktree | `git status --short --branch`, `pnpm run git:check` | Clean at HEAD `c6b08f5` except this task's own two new files under the newly created `docs/build-log/phase-01/` directory. No untracked application file. |
| Branches/PRs | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` (state `open`) | `[]` — zero open PRs, single active branch `claude/lanjut-btusq6`. |
| Migrations | Repository-wide file listing | Zero migration file exists anywhere (`supabase/migrations/` does not exist yet — `supabase/config.toml` remains an empty scaffold). No migration-ID collision is possible; `PLT-105` will be the first task to introduce one. |
| Schema | `05_DATABASE_SCHEMA_WORKSTREAM.md` §1/§3 (resolved `ADR-CAND-ARCH-007`) | Single `app` schema, no tables exist yet. No collision possible at this checkpoint. |
| Scripts/package manifests | `git ls-files` top-level listing | Unchanged from Phase 0's closing state: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/**` (foundation tooling), `supabase/config.toml`, `.env.example`, `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/`, `tests/`. No new script/config file was added by this task. |
| `docs/build-log/phase-01/` (new directory) | Directory listing | Contains exactly this file and `00_PLATFORM_CORE_WBS.md`, both newly created by this task. No pre-existing content to collide with. |

**Result: zero file/schema/environment collision found**, consistent with the repository's confirmed-greenfield status carried forward unchanged from Phase 0's own closure (`docs/build-log/phase-00/PHASE0_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` §2.6).
